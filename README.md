# Battleship Web
This project is the frontend for a Battleship game simulator, built using Angular. It allows users to simulate gameplay between two players based on the classic Battleship board game rules.

If you want to check for yourself, I would advise to get the [backend](https://github.com/adanyk/battleshipApi) first, and then come back here.
